# Managers Guide to Sabrina Sarver
A User’s Guide to Working With Sabrina Sarver


## Introduction
I’m writing this user guide to give you a better sense of me and my unique values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible.


## How I View Success
 A manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for their team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are: people—hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; purpose—clarity on what success looks like; and process—clarity on how to best work together. Of these three levers, I believe people is the most important.



## How I Communicate
I am clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk through my thoughts out loud, which can sometimes feel rambly or sound confusing. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or be precise with action items.



## Things I Do That May Annoy You or Be Misunderstood
Being a designer, I am very comfortable with ambiguity and living in the gray zone where there is potentially a better idea just around the corner. This can be annoying to people who want to nail down specifics or who want to commit to plans and then not change them.



## What Gains and Loses My Trust
I appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. If you are the overly optimistic type (I am one as well) who tends to overcommit to more than can be reasonably done, I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment can’t be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y.



## My Strengths
I’m good at staying calm and collected in a crisis. This works well for doing Incident Response.



## My Growth Areas
I’d like to work on growing patience with people I'm preceiving to be rude or un-respectful.



## Logistics

How do you like to stay in sync with your reports or colleagues? What preferences do you have for one-on-one meetings? Would you prefer people to contact you via email, chat, or in-person? What’s your availability outside of working hours?



## Giving and Receiving Feedback

What is your philosophy around feedback? What can people expect in receiving feedback from you? How would you prefer to receive feedback from your peers?
